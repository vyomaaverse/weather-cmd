- WeatherAPI.com API: A comprehensive weather data API offering a wide range of weather information for locations worldwide.

## GitHub Copilot Integration

GitHub Copilot plays a significant role in the development of this tool. It assists in various aspects, including:

- API Usage: GitHub Copilot generates API requests, including the endpoint, parameters, and authentication, simplifying integration with the WeatherAPI.com API.
- Data Parsing: Copilot provides suggestions and code snippets for parsing the JSON or XML responses from the WeatherAPI.com API, making it easier to extract the relevant weather data.
- Error Handling: GitHub Copilot offers guidance on implementing error handling mechanisms, such as exception handling and error status code checks, ensuring a robust and reliable tool.

## Usage

To use the Weather Forecasting Tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install the required dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a free account on [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and obtain an API key. Paste the API Key in the .env file.

```py
# .env file
API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

4. Run the command-line tool and provide the name of the city for which you want to retrieve the weather forecast.

```py
# cd into the weathercli folder
cd weathercli
python -m weathercli forecast <city-name>

# Example
python -m weathercli forecast London

# wrap city name in quotes if it contains spaces
python -m weathercli forecast "New York"
```

5. The tool will fetch the weather data from the WeatherAPI.com API and display the current forecast for the specified city.
